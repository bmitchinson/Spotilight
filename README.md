Share your public playlists and view them easily across all devices and browsers.

# Features
* "Spotlight Selection" for a pinned highlight of your library.
* Public backlog of past Spotlight Selections
* Profile info pulled from Spotify API: all public playlists in sync with your library in real time.
* Playlist Searching
* Development documented at [benmitchinson.com](https://benmitchinson.com/Making-Spotilight)

# Would be cool if
* Apple music supported, usage of an API to convert playlists? (Switch between spotify or apple music mode, user preference)
Reliant on this api: https://soundiiz.com/api :(

* Hosted @ benmitchinson.com, along side the rest of my portfolio blog
