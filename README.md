## A Vanilla JS SPA to show off your spotify playlists.</br>
Share your public playlists across both Spotify and Apple Music, and view them easily on all devices and browsers.

# Features
* "Spotlight Selection" for a pinned highlight of your library.
* Public backlog of past Spotlight Selections
* Spotify API usage, so that all public playlists are automatically displayed
* Playlist Searching
* Development documented at [benmitchinson.com](https://benmitchinson.com)

# Would be cool if
* Apple music supported, usage of an API to convert playlists? (Switch between spotify or apple music mode, user preference)
* Hosted @ benmitchinson.com, along side the rest of the hexo blog
